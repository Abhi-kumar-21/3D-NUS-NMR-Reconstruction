This repository contains files for reconstruction of 3D NUS NMR Spectra. 

Code is in python.

Scheduler file contains the poission sampling schedule.

For Testing, check DenseNet_3D_NUS_NMR.ipynb file last section. This section is about loading 2D matrices files of 3D NMR data. 

Also, I'm not adding EDHRN model code but I you can find EDHRN_3d.h5.

At the time of ploting Pearson Correaltion plot make sure you are giving right size to the code.

Scheduler:
  Scheduler.xlsx : Contain 25% NUS scheduling for 128x32 matrix. (For Training)
  Scheduler_12.xlsx : Contain 12.5% NUS scheduling for 128x32 matrix. (For Training)
  Scheduler_25.xlsx : Contain 25% NUS scheduling for 120x32 matrix. (For testing with EDHRN model)
  Scheduler_125.xlsx : Contain 12.5% NUS scheduling for 120x32 matrix. (For testing with EDHRN model)
