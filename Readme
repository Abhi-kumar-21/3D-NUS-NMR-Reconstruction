This repository contains files for reconstruction of 3D NUS NMR Spectra. 
Code is in python.
Scheduler file contains the poission sampling schedule.

For Testing, check DenseNet_3D_NUS_NMR.ipynb file last section. This section is about loading 2D matrices files of 3D NMR data. 

Also, I'm not adding EDHRN.h5 code here since it is available on github.

At the time of ploting Pearson Correaltion plot make sure you are giving right size to the code.
